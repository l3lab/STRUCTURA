# "STRUCTURA" Interactive Installation
The purpose of this work is to study human-machine interaction by means of an abstract sign system which can be configured by the viewer. 
MNLT project (http://soundcloud.com/mnltwave) that emerged from dark ambient live sessions of two acts, Symphocat and E110, contributed the sound landscape to the installation.
"STRUCTURA" was designed as an immersive construction which allows the viewer to grasp a "technologically sublime" experience.
